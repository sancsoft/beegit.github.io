Today, we're very happy to formally welcome the newest member of our editorial team, Matt Bixenstine! 

Matt started in August, taking on the role of editorial manager. 

Prior to joining Beegit, Matt made a living telling compelling stories. He spent more than six years as an editor at PR Newswire Association. Before that, he lived the life of a traveling sports writer, with stops working in media relations for the Miami Dolphins and in the athletics department at the University of Maryland. Matt has an undergraduate degree and a master's degree from Ohio University. 

For Beegit's [content marketing services department](https://beegit.com/content-marketing-services), Matt will take on a strategy and management role, working directly with both our customers and our internal editorial network. This area of our business has kicked into hypergrowth in 2015, and Matt's experience will add great perspective on how to grow our customers' inbound content funnel. He's already working with several customers, guiding the content work that is helping them scale their businesses. 

Born and raised in Akron, Ohio, Matt now lives in Lakewood with his fiancée, Alyse, and their very spirited hound dog. Aside from his interest in all things storytelling, Matt's family owns a <a href="http://www.blimpcitybikeandhike.com/" target="_blank">bike and hike shop in Akron</a> and you can regularly find him peddling around Northeast Ohio (that's him in that scenic Cleveland shot at the top of the post).

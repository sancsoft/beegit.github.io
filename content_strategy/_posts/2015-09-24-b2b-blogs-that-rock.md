Like a tourist destination, a blog destination must offer uniqueness, widespread appeal and a pinch of pizzazz.

But just as most places are a far cry from Turks and Caicos, most B2B blogs simply lack those traits necessary to draw substantial visitation. Neither tourism dollars nor business leads are generated.

People ask us all the time -- just how do you go about establishing a successful B2B blog? Frankly, it's difficult and requires a great deal of effort and commitment. <a class="tweet-quote">If blogging were easy, everyone would be doing it (well).</a> 

There's something to be said for having a sound distribution strategy; there's something else entirely to be said for making your blog the destination for a topic that drives your business. That's storytelling that creates value for your readers while also helping them understand the story of your business. 

You can accomplish this two-pronged objective through many methods -- industry tips, inside looks at your team, feature updates, etc. Ultimately, though, the goal must be sharing knowledge and driving leads to your business.


To become the best, start by reading the best. The elite are as diverse as they are talented. Some of the following industry-leading blogs are fresh-faced startups, while others are heavy hitters who have been getting content marketing right for years.

Editorial confession: A few of these bloggers are tools we use and a few others are Beegit customers. But their blogs still rock. Each blog listed below (in no particular order, by the way) comes with an example post that shows their stuff. Your next destination? B2B blog bliss.

### <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog" target="_blank">1. Baremetrics</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/Shpigford" target="_blank">Josh Pigford</a>, founder of Baremetrics, is great at putting together a compelling and transparent narrative. It helps that this blog is filled with business tips that impact your bottom line (and, it just so happens, they help you watch that bottom line with analytics for Stripe data).

The consistency, the detailed examples, the in-depth content... it makes the editorial team at Beegit happier than someone using "farther" and "further" correctly. Or maybe it's just the ever-eloquent <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmy_daly" target="_blank">Jimmy Daly</a>, who routinely gives us blog gold with his prose: "Welcome emails are the Daryl Dixon of lifecycle email marketing. Soft-spoken, sometimes overlooked yet **always** kicking ass."

They crush guest posts that show you how to use their product while telling someone else's story (full disclosure: we know firsthand from a guest blog we did with them in 2014). They also do candor better than most, particularly when they discuss their growing pains and product roadmap.

### <a href="http://slackhq.com/" target="_blank">4. Slack</a>
Of course the Slack team gets their blog right. Do they do anything poorly? They're like that rich, popular kid you want to hate, but then they offer to help you with your homework. They do feature updates and how-tos better than anyone. Those aren't our favorite things in a blog, but they do them so well we forget that. Bonus points to them for a great blog title (Several People are Typing).

### <a href="https://twitter.com/Jay_zo" target="_blank">8 & 8 1/2 Jay Acunzo</a>
Jay Acunzo is technically only getting one spot on this list, but he has two blogs worth reading: <a href="http://www.sorryformarketing.com/blog/" target="_blank">Sorry For Marketing</a> and <a href="http://nextviewventures.com/blog/" target="_blank">The View From The Seed</a>. It's not often a two-way player comes along. The VP of Platform at NextView Ventures contributes both a personal content marketing blog and a venture capitalist blog for his firm. Both are of high quality. A blogger who counts both content marketers and VCs among his audience? Even Deion Sanders and Bo Jackson should be proud.

Is it a blog if it's your whole business? We don't know and we don't care. It's not surprising that a business built on content marketing gets content marketing so right. But it's still impressive.
